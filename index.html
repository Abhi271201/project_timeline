    <h1>Welcome to My ELR Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Abhi Vasubhai, and this is my Engineering Leadership Readiness (ELR) portfolio designed to demonstrate my progress, leadership development, and project management skills over the course of the semester.</p>

    <p>Through this platform, you'll find a comprehensive overview of my journey—from planning and strategizing to executing key tasks and reflecting on leadership growth. Each section of this portfolio reflects critical thinking, collaboration, and a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>

    <p>Be sure to explore the <strong>Project Timeline</strong> section to view a detailed Gantt Chart outlining the schedule and milestones of my ELR project. I invite you to follow along as I build a foundation for my future as an engineering leader.</p>
